## Introduction

As the reader probably knows, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) is a social media platform where people can engage with whomever they'd like to talk to, such as their friends, family, movie stars, and so on. You can create small messages, up to a limited amount of characters (280), and share them with people who _follow_ you on the platform. The level of engagement that you can get by following your friends and people you admire is quite incredible. You can have entire conversations with people you'd never thought you'd talk to due to geographical concerns, for instance.

The main goal is to somehow recreate the implementation of _Twitter_ as a training exercise to demonstrate how it can be possible to engineer a distributed system.
