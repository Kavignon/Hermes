# Design of Hermes

_Note: The intent behind the document is to define the important elements of the architecture, how the components will look and interact with each other and how will the data flow in between different parts of the application. When designing a system, the purpose is to put together a tangible product that will **satisfy** specific needs and the business requirements. Anything other than that will be wasted efforts._

## Notes and research

While working on this project, a lot of research was done to put together a well-thought example for the demonstration. You can certainly read the blog series (**not available yet**) or you can take a peek at the note document that I created along the way [here](#docs/system-design/notes-and-research.md)
